The "ML" course at Stanford , or to say the most popular Machine Learning course Worldwide is CS229. CS229 is Math Heavy and is 🔥, unlike a simplified online version at Coursera, "[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)". I [completed](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/4G25AQXD9LDG) the online version as a Freshaman and here I take the CS229 Stanford version. I have access to the 2012 video lectures of CS229 from [ClassX](http://classx.stanford.edu/) (I downloaded them, while I was a visiting student at Stanford). All in all, we have the slides, notes from the course website to learn the content. Stay truthful, maintain Honor Code and Keep Learning.
