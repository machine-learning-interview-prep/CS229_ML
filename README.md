# [CS229 : Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/)

<img src="https://github.com/SKKSaikia/CS229_ML/blob/master/img/cs229.jpg">

The "ML" course at Stanford , or to say the most popular Machine Learning course Worldwide is CS229. CS229 is Math Heavy and is 🔥, unlike a simplified online version at Coursera, "[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)". I [completed](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/4G25AQXD9LDG) the online version as a Freshaman and here I take the CS229 Stanford version. I have access to the 2013 video lectures of CS229 from [ClassX](http://classx.stanford.edu/) (I downloaded them, while I was a visiting student at Stanford). All in all, we have the slides, notes from the course website to learn the content. Stay truthful, maintain Honor Code and Keep Learning. Learning is a journey!

# Course:

<p align="justify">This course provides a broad introduction to <b>machine learning</b> and <b>statistical pattern recognition</b>. Topics include: <b>supervised learning</b> (generative/discriminative learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector machines); <b>unsupervised learning</b> (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods); <b>learning theory</b> (bias/variance tradeoffs; VC theory; large margins); <b>reinforcement learning and adaptive control</b>. The course will also discuss recent applications of machine learning, such as to robotic control, data mining, autonomous navigation, bioinformatics, speech recognition, and text and web data processing.</p>

# FINAL PROJECT

CS229 gives a lot of importance to Final Project, going through the [past projects](http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects.html) , I was happy to see the dynamic range of wonderful ideas and application of ML all the way. Good CS229 projects are either publishable or minor changes to be able to publish the project. [NIPS (NeurIPS)](https://nips.cc/) , [ICML](https://icml.cc/) are the ML conferences to show ML works to other people around the world. I was ecstatic to start my own and did " ".
